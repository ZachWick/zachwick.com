  <p>
	On the plane back from LibrePlanet 2014, I have tried to put
	together a debrief, but as I am running on about three hours of
	sleep, I am not sure how coherent these thoughts will end up
	being.
	<br/><br/>
	I always leave LibrePlanet feeling very inspired and ready to go
	forth and hack on even more. In retrospect, it is strange, and
	kind of sad maybe, that what I do for a day job is not this
	inspiring. I thoroughly enjoy what I do though, so maybe this
	phenomenon occurs only because LibrePlanet is especially
	inspiring.
	<br/><br/>
	Once again, LibrePlanet afforded me the opportunity to interact
	with people in the flesh that I usually only interact with via
	email or IRC.<br/>
	And of course, I also met lots of new people who are working on
	even cooler projects.
	<br/><br/>
	I am eagerly awaiting all of the talks having their recordings
	posted so that I can watch all of the talks that I had to pass up
	in order to attend other talks (or give my own.).
	<br/><br/>
	I am very grateful to the staff, volunteers, and attendees that
	made LibrePlanet a success and am looking forward to next year.
  </p>
