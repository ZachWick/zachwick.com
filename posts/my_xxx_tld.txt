My .XXX TLD
2013-12-4

Some time ago I
purchased zachwick.xxx[0] because I thought that it could be funny
someday. I get quite a bit of enjoyment from sending email replies
from that domain to spammy recruiter emails and from giving out that
same email in various professional settings. (See the end
of my "Python + FUSE" talk for a real life example)
Today I got the following email from the ICM Registry that made me
laugh given that I host my personal blog on a .XXX TLD:

The content of this email just makes me feel like my blog posts
should have adds for sex toys and such embedded within them.
The whole point of me buying a .XXX TLD was to get laughs out of
it, so mission accomplished I guess.
