	Towards the end of March, I attended LibrePlanet 2013 in Boston,
	MA. This was a weekend conference put on by the Free Software
	Foundation that was all about free software and bringing together
	members of the various free software communities. It was a
	fantastic weekend! I attended a few talks, and a workshop/install
	party, and learned a whole bunch.
	<br/><br/>
	Thursday evening, I met some people for dinner that I had only
	ever know from IRC. Little did I realize that this was going to
	the be the case all weekend!
	<br/><br/>
	Friday morning I explored Cambridge, Harvard's campus, and MIT's
	campus. Then after a quick lunch, I took the T downtown to work
	out of the Free Software Foundation's office. While it was kind of
	strange to putz away on my day job work from a place that would
	frown on what I do for my day job, it went very well, and I met
	even more people in person that I had only known from IRC.
	<br/><br/>
	Friday evening there was a meet-and-greet at the FSF office, where
	once again, meeting IRC people in the flesh was the order of the
	day.
	<br/><br/>
	Saturday began the "actual" conference, and I walked to the
	Harvard Science Center with much enthusiasm. After a breakfast and
	some quick conversations, it was off to the talks and workshops!
	<br/><br/>
	One of the talks that I attended was on the recently passed MA
	Right-to-Repair law. The talk was generally about the free
	software that may (or may not be) in cars, and how recent
	legislation is driving more people towards free software.
	<br/><br/>
	Another talk that I attended was on IceCat and LibreJS. IceCat is
	a GNU project that is a web browser based off of Mozilla Firefox
	with all of the Mozilla branded stripped out, and added privacy
	features. LibreJS is a Firefox/Icecat/Iceweasel plugin that allows
	users to avoid the "javascript trap" of running non-free
	javascript on thier machines. These two projects are near and dear
	to me as I hack on them, but it was very nice to meet my
	collaborators in person.
	<br/><br/>
	I also attended a talk by Stefano Zacchiroli, the current Debian
	Project Leader, about what the Debian Project is doing to become a
	Free Software Foundation endorsed distro. This talk, and some of
	the discussion afterwards were the catalyst that made me change
	from my beloved Arch GNU/Linux to Debian GNU/Linux on my main
	machines. 
	<br/><br/>
	Then of course there were the Free Software Awards, preceeded by a
	talk from rms (Richard M. Stallman, Founder of the GNU Project and
	FSF). The talk was what I expected, and the awards were given to
	deserving projects.
	<br/><br/>
	I also went to the workshop/install party for Replicant and
	Coreboot. Replicant is an Android fork that has of the non-free
	parts taken out, as well as all of the Google specific parts. The
	end result is a cell phone that runs on (mostly) free
	software. There are still some non-free firmware bits, but that is
	almost unavoidable. The second part of this install party
	pertained to Coreboot. Coreboot is a BIOS replacement that is
	entirely free software. While my machine is not able to run
	Coreboot, it was pretty cool to talk with one of the developers of
	Coreboot and learn more about how BIOS's actually work.
	<br/><br/>
	In the end, LibrePlanet 2013 was a great experience. I learned a
	whole lot about various free software projects and free software
	in general. I will definitely be going back next year.
