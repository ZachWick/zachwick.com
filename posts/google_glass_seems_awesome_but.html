	Google Glass is awesome technology - there is no doubt about that;
	And wearable computing is probably going to be the next big
	thing. So why the "but" in the title then, since I have already
	admitted that Glass is awesome? The "but" is that Google Glass is
	going to play a big part in making people complacent with being
	constantly recorded by the average citizen. Google Glass might not
	be the catalyst for this complacency, but Glass is definitely the
	first major chip in the mortar.
	<br/><br/>
	Consider cell phones; When cell phones first became popular, they
	were for placing/receiving calls and texts - nothing more. Now,
	cell phones have become a social crutch to a vast majority of the
	population. There are people who go through withdrawal when
	without their cell phone for a <em>few hours</em>. I cannot
	remember the last time that I had a conversation with somebody
	during which they did not look at (or fuss with) their cell
	phone. We even go so far as to laud this behaviour. Take for
	instance the new Facebook Home commercials. These ads are based on
	the premise that people want to escape reality into their phones,
	at the exspense of meaningful human interaction.
	<br/>
	My point here about cell phones is that they started as an
	innocent and extremely ambitious idea to help people communicate
	better/easier, and now they have become the mechanism by which we
	prevent meaningful human interaction.
	<br/><br/>
	With Google Glass, I fear that a similar process with take
	place. Glass is going to start out as helping many people in many
	meaningful ways. But then it is going to turn into something
	sinister; If Glass becomes as popular as other Google products, in
	a year or two, it will  not be unreasonable to have close to half
	of the people that you interact with on a regular basis be wearing
	Glass. Consider that this means that 50% of the people that you
	see throughout the day can record any thing that you do or say,
	and you would have no visual clues that you are being
	recorded.<br/><br/>
	That snide comment about your boss - recorded.<br/>
	That personal call made from work - recorded.<br/>
	Speeding in your car, even just a little bit - recorded.<br/>
	That embarrasing purchase at the store - recorded.<br/>
	Your morning jog past that creepy guy's house - recorded.<br/>
	Your daily routine - recorded.<br/>
	That extra 15minutes that you where away at lunch - recorded.<br/>
	<br/>
	With Glass, and the technologies that proceed from it, every
	little detail of you existence will be recorded. There is no
	question about it. It is safe to assume that there will be at
	least one person recording you at any given instant.<br/>
	This is a terrifying reality; Who needs the stationary telescreens
	from "Nineteen Eighty-Four" when there are mobile telescreens
	mounted on the faces of a majority of the population?
