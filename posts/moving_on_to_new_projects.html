  <p>
	A week ago today, I gave my notice at Barracuda Networks where I
	have been employed for the last seventeen months; My last day
	hacking on <a href="https://copy.com">Copy.com</a> will be this
	Friday. I am leaving Copy for one reason: The role that I had
	there was not one that would keep me happy, feeling
	fulfilled, and be constantly forcing me to improve my
	craft. Hacking on Copy has been a by-and-large positive
	experience.<br/><br/>
	In my tenure there I honed my skills and learned how
	to operate in a corporate environment (something that I had never
	experienced before). I really do think that Copy is a great
	product and the people working on it are incredible - I see big
	things in Copy's future and I am kind of sad that I will miss out
	on experiencing them firsthand. When I started working on the Copy
	web app, it was very very barebones. I helped flesh out its
	initial feature set, and then worked on implementing new features
	and participated in the team growing and growing. I think that I
	was number seven-ish on the Copy team, and am leaving a team of twenty
	nine not counting myself. The Copy account that I created on my
	first day has a user id in the tens of thousands (lots of early
	test accounts I guess) and now Copy has over two million active
	users.<br/><br/>
	I will miss my Copy coworkers, and I wish them well. I plan on
	focusing on getting the projects in my idea list implemented, so
	look for those to appear
	on <a href="https://github.com/zachwick">Github</a> and/or
	my <a href="http://repos.zachwick.com/public">personal
	site</a>.<br/><br/>
	To the Copy folks that may end up seeing this, I have only this to
	say:<br/><br/>
	<em>So long, and thanks for all the fish.</em>
