	As a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ideologue, I think about
	my implicit and explicit use of various software systems daily (if
	not hourly). I would love nothing more than to be able to not use
	any proprietary softare or hardware in my daily existence;
	However, there are a myriad things that I could not do then such
	as:
	<ul>
	  <li>Drive my car</li>
	  <li>Use a cellphone
		<ul>
		  <li>While there are are FOSS apps available and FOSS software
			systems, almost of the firmware is proprietary (If I recall
			correctly)</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Use a microwave oven</li>
	  <li>Use a gas/electric oven</li>
	  <li>Use a washing machine</li>
	  <li>Use a gas/electric clothes dryer</li>
	  <li>Use a gas/electric hot water heater
	  <li>Use a modern refridgerator</li>
	  <li>Check out a book from the public library (the barcode scanner etc.)</li>
	  <li>Perform my job as a web developer. I need to test my code
	  against Safari, Chrome, and IE.</li>
	  <li>Use any of my guns to hunt. All of them were made in a
	  factory using proprietary designs, equipment, machine firmware,
	  etc.</li>
	  <li>Print a digital document.</li>
	</ul>
	This list is clearly non-exhaustive; These ares simply the things
	that I could think of off of the top of my head. Granted, some of
	these activities could be done using only FOSS hardware and
	software, but I would have to build them myself - none of these
	systems/objects exist in a form where I can simply go to the store
	and purchase one. And no person has enough time, or money, to
	build each of these things for themself.
	<br/><br/>
	This train of thought has been running around in my head for
	months. I find it almost shamefull that I continue to use
	proprietary hardware and software on a daily basis. I am disgusted
	with myself because while I extoll the virtues of FOSS, I turn
	around and take a hot shower, or use a microwave oven - and fall
	into complacency with proprietary systems.
	<br/><br/>
	In keeping with this train of thought, I am going to try and
	simplify my life so that I use a minimal amount of proprietary
	systems. I am going to get rid of most of my computers and replace
	them with a single, all FOSS machine. Even this set of actions is
	frought with pitfalls: I will need to figure out some entirely
	FOSS way to do cross-browser compatibility testing. I will need to
	ensure that I can get this machine to connect to my employer's
	crazy networking scheme (This is actually the biggest issue that I
	foresee). And, I will need to make sure that I can do everything
	that I would ever need to using only this machine.
	<br/><br/>
	I will keep posting here with updates on how this journey goes -
	assuming that I can get this server migrated from Ubuntu Server to
	a Free OS without incident!
