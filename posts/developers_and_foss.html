	With the exceptions that I have noted in previous posts, I
	endeavor to use only software that is free as in freedom. Even in
	the course of my day job as a web developer, I use an entirely
	FOSS software stack for development. When it comes time to test
	what I have written, I break out non-free web browsers, but only
	to ensure that the end users don't suffer. While this assuredly
	enables the continued propagation of non-free software, it is a
	decision that is made by my employer and thus out of my control.
	<br/><br/>
	The office in which I work is an "open floor plan" - such a layout
	has many advantages. In my opinion, the greatest advantage is the
	ability to very easily collaborate with my fellow developers. This
	collaboration is also the cause of almost all of my workplace
	consternation; Invariably, when I start "talking shop" with one of
	my fellow developers, or having them look at some code on my
	machine, the questions about my web browser choice, editor choice,
	and choices of other programs start. The editor question is
	generally the easiest to field, but as soon as I mention why I use
	Icecat as my primary browser, my fellow developers' brains turn
	off and their mocking ensues. I am not trying to show that I am a
	victim here. I am just astounded that people who make their living
	coding cannot see the value of free software. One of my co-workers
	in particular seems oblivious to the fact that the code he works
	with everyday in only possible because the authors of the
	underlaying libraries saw the value in free software and released
	their libraries as such.
	<br/><br/>
	It is the developers who have the skill-set to appreciate the
	technical merits of free software. A developer can look at the
	code and recognize the beauty of the collective thought that went
	into the codebase. A developer can look at the code and recognize
	ugly parts and make those parts beautiful. A developer has the
	power to ensure that the code he creates in free as in freedom and
	respects the rights of his users and his fellow developers. And
	yet, it is developers who hold back the growth of free
	software. We do this by agreeing to make non-free software (this
	is something that I have done, and continue to do in my day
	job). We do this by using free software and not helping to fix
	bugs that we find in it. We do this by questioning other's use of
	free software. We do this by allowing ourselves to use non-free
	software and implicitly give our consent for the continued
	development of non-free software.
	<br/><br/>
	In an effort to make sure that I am no longer a developer who is
	holding back the growth of free software, I have resolved to help
	fix bugs that I find in the free software that I use. To that end,
	I have become a contributor
	the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/"
	target="_blank">Icecat</a>
	and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/"
	target="_blank">LibreJS</a> projects. I have also resolved to make
	sure that I do not question others' choices of which free software
	programs they use; I will make sure that I only question their use
	of non-free software and take steps to ensure that the resulting
	conversation is a postive learning experience for them. I have
	also resolved to be even more harsh in removing the use of
	non-free software from my use. The other step that I have resolved
	to take is to actively work to make as much of the code that I
	produce for my day job free software and work in enact a
	philosophical change in my team's view of free software. Without a
	doubt, this last resolution will be the hardest.
	<br/><br/>
	I ask other developers to critically examine the software that
	they use and create, and resolve to work for the growth of free
	software instead of against it.
