	Icecat is the GNU project version of Mozilla Firefox. The main
	advantage of Icecat over Firefox, and the major difference between
	the two, is that Icecat codebase and ecosystem is entirely free
	software while Firefox is not. Firefox reccomends non-free plugins
	and add-ons, and Icecat only reccomends and distributes free
	software.
	<br/>
	<h3>Installing Icecat</h3>
	You can get the source for Icecat
	from <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnuzilla/">Savannah</a>
	and built in the usual manner.<br/>
	If building from source isn't quite your thing, the GNUzilla team
	also provides built tarballs that you can easily download,
	un-archive, and run. The latest version of Icecat can be
	downloaded
	from <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnuzilla/17.0/">GNU FTP</a>
	(make sure to get the 32bit or 64bit version, whichever is right
	for your system).<br/>
	You should then untar the archive [tar -xzvf path/to/archive] and
	then move the resulting directory to somewhere in your $PATH. On
	my system, I moved the icecat-17.0.1 directory to /usr/local/bin
	by executing [sudo mv icecat-17.0.1 /usr/local/bin].<br/>
	You will then need to `cd` to /usr/local/bin and create an
	executable symlink the icecat executable. [sudo ln -s
	icecat-17.0.1 ./icecat].<br/>
	If you now execute [which icecat], the path to this newly created
	symlink should be printed to your terminal. You now have a fully
	installed and useable Icecat on your system.
	<h3>Adding Icecat to the Debian Alternatives System</h3>
	The Debian Alternatives system allows for user configurable
	'default' applications to use for specific functions. Using the
	Alternatives system, you can easily configure which program your
	system uses as an editor, a mail client, a web browser, etc. In
	order to set Icecat as the browser that all links will open in,
	you must add it to the Alternatives system. By executing <br/><br/>
	sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/icecat x-www-browser /usr/local/bin/icecat 90 <br/><br/>
	Icecat will be added the Alternatives system and set to the
	highest priority. Now, all links will open in Icecat.
