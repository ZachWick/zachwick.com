	I am writing this post a little under a month after
	writing <a href="a_day_using_only_foss.html">"A Day Using Only
	FOSS"</a>.
	<br/>
	This month has seen some substantial changes in how I use the
	technology around me. For starters, I sold my Apple MacBookPro
	that I was using as my daily driver for development at my day
	job. I am now using the same Trisquel box for both day job
	development and side project development. This has resulted in me
	(seemingly) being more productive in both kinds of projects. I
	attribute this productivity increase to not having to think about
	where a particular config file is, and not having to recall how to
	do things in different applications. I still beholden to running
	Windows in a VM in order to do cross-browser testing, but I see no
	entirely FOSS way around that.
	<br/><br/>
	I have also stopped using my Apple iPhone4 and started using a
	Samsung Galaxy S3 with the AOKP Rom. Using this phone and the
	F-Droid store (along with the Google Play Store) to ensure that I
	am only installing and using Free as in Freedom apps is quite
	nice. There is still non-free software running on this phone
	however. Namely the radio firmware stack and other bits of
	firmware. I looked into
	the <a href="http://replicant.us">Replicant Project</a>, but the
	S3 is not an officially supported device and I haven't had the
	time to muck about with it.
	<br/><br/>
	I still am using the non-free software in my car and in my other
	household appliances, but those are harder to just switch out than
	an operating system. All in all, I think that I have made
	significant strides in moving my technology away from non-free
	software. The next step is definitely getting an entirely free
	cellphone up and running as I use that device many times each
	day. Look for that post in the future.
