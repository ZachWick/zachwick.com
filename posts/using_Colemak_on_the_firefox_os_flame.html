	As I mentioned in my previous post, I have been using a FirefoxOS
	Flame developer reference phone as my daily driver. It has now
	been about two months, and I couldn't be happier with the
	phone (you can read my initial review of the
	Flame <a href="../posts/using_the_firefox_os_flame.html">here</a>).<br/><br/>
	I use the Colemak layout for all of my keyboards, so I was
	disappointed when the FirefoxOS 2.2 builds had the Dvorak layout
	but not Colemak. As any good developer would do, I promptly cloned
	the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia">gaia repo</a>
	and got ready to muck around in the system's keyboard app. Much to
	my initial dismay of being able to contribute something sweet to
	the community, I found that the Colemak layout was already there,
	it just wasn't enabled in the default list of layouts to
	build. This means that instead of hacking together some JS, all
	that is required to get the Colemak layout on your device is
	editing one line in a Makefile, building gaia, and flashing onto
	your device.<br/><br/>
	<h3>You should backup your device before mucking around in gaia</h3>
	I am not going to write about hacking on Gaia itself, that
	information can be readily had
	from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Gaia">Gaia's
	MDN page</a>.
	<h3>Adding Colemak to the Keyboard Layouts</h3>
	In order to get the Colemak layout on your FirefoxOS device you
	must first get the gaia source. It can be cloned from Github by
	doing:<br/><br/>
	git clone https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia<br/>
	cd gaia<br/><br>
	You can look in the /apps/keyboard directory to see the source of
	the system's keyboard app, but we aren't going to touch anything
	in there. We are going to modify gaia's toplevel Makefile.<br/>
	Open 'Makefile' in you editor of choice. Search for
	'GAIA_KEYBOARD_LAYOUTS'. In my gaia repo it in line 440. This
	environment variable is used to determine which keyboard layouts
	will be built into the system's keyboard app - exactly what we
	want to modify.<br/>
	Feel free to modify this line as you see fit, but in order to get
	the Colemak layout you must at least add 'en-Colemak' to the comma
	separated list of layouts. Make sure to save the file after you
	edit it.<br/>
	Now comes the slightly scary part, we are going to build a new
	version of gaia and flash it onto our FirefoxOS device. Following
	<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Gaia/Different_ways_to_run_Gaia">these
	instructions</a> we can see what we need to do. On that page the
	is a note about only flashing a single app instead of all of the
	gaia apps; There
	is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Gaia/Build_System_Primer">another
	MDN page</a> however that cautions that using the APP environment
	variable with 'reset-gaia' will put your device in an unstable
	state (my experimentation also confirms this). So, we are going to
	have to build gaia in its entirety, which doesn't take more that a
	few minutes.<br/><br/>
	First make sure that you have ADB installed on your machine. There
	are installation instructions
	on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Installing_ADB">MDN</a>,<br/>
	and that you have enabled USB debugging on your device from within
	the Developer menu.<br/>
	Next connect your device to your machine.<br/>
	If you are using a Flame device, you want to issue the following
	command:<br/><br/>
	make reset-gaia GAIA_DEV_PIXELS_PER_PX=1.5<br/><br/>
	The GAIA_DEV_PIXELS_PER_PX environment variable specifies that you
	want to use higher resolution assets. This is mentioned in a note
	in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Gaia/Different_ways_to_run_Gaia">MDN</a>
	but after the 'make reset-gaia' command so it is easy to miss it
	the first time you build gaia.
	Assuming there are no build failures, your device will reboot and
	after you go through the initial setup screens, you will be able
	enable the Colemak layout in the Keyboards Settings
	panel.<br/><br/>
