	With the release of Sublime Text 2.0 here in the last few days, I thought that now would be an appropriate time to write out my reasons for why I won't switch to Sublime Text.
	I have a few co-workers who use Sublime Text. This means that my exposure to ST is limited to watching people who do the same things that I do use it; So comparing my workflow with theirs, I am flabbergasted that they swear by ST.
	<br/>
	<h3>Minimap</h3>
	When I watch these guys hack away in ST, the first cool feature that I see is the minimap of the current file. This is a sweet feature - the bird's eye view of a large file can be extremely helpful at times. However, this feature doesn't sell me on ST. I have minimaps of files in Emacs using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MiniMap">minimap.el</a>. After adding the Emacs Lisp file to your load-path, it is three simple lines of Elisp to bind the 'minimap-create' and 'minimap-kill' to any key combo that you want.
	<br/>
	<h3>Quick Step Next</h3>
	This feature is really cool and has the potential to save you lots of time. However, its inclusion in Sublime Text 2.0 is not the first instance this ability existing. I can do the same thing, editing multiple lines simultaneously, using the rectangle commands built into Emacs (C-x r other_keys).
	<br/>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	Everybody has their editor of choice that has the feature set that they are looking for. My choice of editor is Emacs, and I have yet to see a reason to leave Emacs for any other editor.
	<br/>
	<h3>Addendum</h3>
	Additionally, Emacs has a terminal editor, a text-based web browser, and an email client that come with it. I don't have to mentally or physically leave Emacs (or my beloved key bindings) all day - I am sure that this increases my productivity by some non-trivial amount.
