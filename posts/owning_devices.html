	Own (adjective) - Belonging to oneself or itself - usually used
	following a possessive case or possessive adjective "cooked my own
	dinner"
	<br/><br/>
	The definition of "own" above is the crux of my rant here. I own
	very few electronics; a laptop, a wristwatch, a coffeepot. I am
	owned by many many electronics; a cellphone, a car, a tv, a
	thermostat, a dishwasher, a washing machine, a clothes dryer - the
	list goes on.
	<br/><br/>
	I feel that meager list of three items not because I purchased
	them, but solely because I have the knowledge and ability to
	change any aspect of those devices that I desire.
	<br/><br/>
	I didn't like the operating system that came with my laptop, so I
	installed my own (linux). I didn't like kernel that came with the
	linux distro that I chose, so I built and installed my own. I
	didn't like the default theme for my window manager, so I made my
	own. My laptop is completely customized to be exactly how I want
	it. Let me say that another way - my laptop is completely under my
	absolute control. I don't have to have a corporation tell me that
	I am allowed to install a particular program (ie the Mac App
	store), I am not limited to only programs that use a particular
	graphics library (Cocoa, QT, whatever Windows uses), etc. This
	complete control and customization makes me more productive than
	any other singular thing.
	<br/><br/>
	With my cellphone, I can change the ROM and change which app
	responds to a particular intent. I can also change the system
	kernel and boot image, but I cannot change the bootloader, the
	radio firmware (also called the baseband) or swap out hardware
	components that would allow me these *freedoms*.
	<br/><br/>
	Don't let yourself be owned by your devices. You must work at
	owning them - be it by studying the devices and the related
	internals or by "voting with your dollars" and purchasing freedom
	respecting hardware.
