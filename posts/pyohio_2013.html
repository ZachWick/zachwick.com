	Two weeks ago I attended PyOhio 2013 - It was freaking awesome! I
	had high hopes for PyOhio as the last conference that I attended
	was LibrePlanet (which was also fantastic), and PyOhio did not
	fail to deliver.<br/><br/>
	In addition to listening to some really cool talks, I got to give
	a (hopefully cool) talk on what I work on all day - Copy.com. The
	talks that were presented were on a wide array of Python-centric
	topics and ranged from "novice" to "expert" in subject
	matter.<br/><br/>
	The people at PyOhio were just as interesting as the talks. I met
	one guy from LightSide, who is doing text analysis on student's
	papers. I met another guy who is a developer on Firefox for
	Android and picked his brain on porting GNU Icecat to
	Android. There was another guy that I met who works for Canonical
	on one of their webapps - It was great to trade "war stories" and
	talk shop.<br/><br/>
	My talk on a Python FUSE layer for Copy.com went rather well, and
	for interested people, there is a video posted
	at <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2271/python-fuse">PyVideo</a>
	and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpvdOuTzOU0">YouTube</a>.
	<br/><br/>
	I will definitely be going to PyOhio 2014, and will even try to
	come up with an exciting Python project to talk about.
