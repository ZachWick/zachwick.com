	Just as a painter paints because he enjoys the act of applying
	brush to canvas in order to create a reality out of an abstract
	idea, I code because I enjoy the act of putting fingers to
	keyboard to make a reality out of an abstract idea. Painters don't
	paint because it is incredibly profitable, and I don't code for
	just a paycheck. The money that I make from coding ensures that I
	am able practice the art of coding my own abstract ideas instead
	of someone elses.<br/><br/>
	A day job as a developer will never make me happy nor make me feel
	fulfilled; Only the ability to hack on my own projects can do
	that. For this reason and this reason alone, I view all
	development jobs as the same and compare on the sole criterion of
	how much they enable my outside hacking. David Cronenberg once
	said "The desire to be loved is really death when it comes to
	art." I think that the same sentiment applies to development; If I
	only code for what someone else wants, then I have died as a
	hacker and have lost that part of my being forever.
	<br/><br/>
	I am a hacker. I am an artist. I use electrons, pixels, and
	switches to transform the beauty of the baud into a physical
	reality for my own enjoyment. I derive pleasure from making bits
	cross wires and pixels blink on screens. I experience pain from
	tedium and monotony. I don't write code - I write art.
