Just Picked a Whole Bouquet of Oopsie Daisies
2012-06-19

As you can see, zachwick.com is experiencing some technical
difficulties right now. In the process of trying to clean up my
Linode, I accidentally nuked it completely. Luckily, all of my code
repos live on Github, and this seems a good as time as any to jump
into static bloggin with Jekyll feet first!

The ArduPhone project is still going strong too! I am in the process
of rewriting my singleton functions as classes in a library. That
being so, there is lots of changes happening in the APKeypad and
ArduPhone repos - be aware if you are hacking on them.
