  <p>
	I have been using a Firefox OS Flame developer reference phone as
	my daily driver for a couple of weeks now. I thought that it would
	be a good time to publish my thoughts on the hardware and
	software, and also comment on my first few days of developing for
	FirefoxOS.<br/>
	I first started using Firefox OS way back when
	the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developer_phone_guide/ZTE_OPEN">ZTE
	Open</a> became available in early 2013. I fell in love with the
	idea of Firefox OS, most likely because it was so in step with my
	"compute free or die" attitude (if you sidestep the issue of
	mobile phones having proprietary media codecs and proprietary
	baseband systems). Sadly, the ZTE-Open was only my daily driver
	phone for a week or two because the hardware/software (Firefox OS
	v1.0) required too much handholding for me at the time. I was
	missing important calls/texts/emails due to software bugs and hard
	resets, and for quite a while I had a notification that I could
	never clear and a notification tray that I could not open. Because
	of that, the ZTE-Open got regulated to a shelf in my shop where I
	would occasionally pull it out and putter around developing for
	it, but it never made it back into my pocket for longer than a
	week or so. I did talk
	to <a href="http://fossetcon.org/2014/speakers/robert-call">Bob
	Call</a> who was also using a ZTE-Open, but he didn't seem to have
	the same issues that I was (probably because he is used to working
	on things like the ZTE-Open)<br/><br/>
	I saw the announcement of the Flame developer reference phone, but
	didn't pre-order one because of my experience with the
	ZTE-Open. It was only after I
	heard <a href="http://christianheilmann.com/">Christian
	Heilmann</a> speak at IoTCon 2014 in Berlin, Germany (I attended
	both of his talks) that I decided to get a Flame
	phone. Christian's first talk was about the "Mobile Web" and how
	it can be a common platform across many devices. His second talk
	was specifically about Firefox OS and its current state.<br/><br/>
	I was once again hooked.<br/><br/>
	I ordered a Flame phone the day that I got home, and have been
	using and abusing it since it arrived a few days later.<br/>
	My Flame came with Firefox OS v1.3 on it. The improvements over
	v1.2 (which I was able to compile and flash onto the ZTE-Open
	myself) were phenomenal. I wasn't missing calls, texts, or emails
	and with the exception of a <a href="http://pump.io">PumpIO</a>
	client, there were apps for everything that I wanted. The Flame
	replaced a Nexus 5 and met the standard of reliablity that the
	Nexus had set. My wife started using the Nexus 5, so now I had to
	be careful about hacking too deep on the Flame because there was
	no going back.<br/><br/>
	<h3>The Software</h3>
	I flashed the Firefox OS v2.0 base image later that
	first week and was once again blown away by the software. In v2.0,
	the homescreen scrolls vertically and scrolling horizontally
	switches between open apps. Just as the change from iOS to Android
	made me love the paradigm of the back button (I know, I used to be
	an iOS guy), this switch to the crazy Firefox OS scrolling has me
	convinced that it is a better user experience. The only part of
	this new scrolling experience that still strikes me as weird is
	that when browsing the internet, opening a link in a new tab both
	creates the new tab as a new horizontal scrolling target and
	pushes me to it. I don't mind the new scrolling target, but I wish
	that there was an option to not automatically navigate me to the
	new tab (there may be, but I haven't found it).<br/>
	I then flashed a nightly build and set the phone to do OTA updates
	from the nightly build tree. This was pretty scary for the first
	few days since I had no other phone to fall back to (other than
	the ZTE-Open of course) but now I sleep easy knowing that the
	morning's update will be just fine.<br/>
	The only outstanding software issue that is really annoying is
	that sometimes when I receive a call, when I answer the call the
	vibration and ringing stop. But then as soon as I hang up (1 or 30
	minutes later) the phone keeps vibrating as if I am receiving a
	call. Everything else works just fine at these times - I can use
	apps, send texts, whatever, but the phone is just constantly
	vibrating. Putting the phone to sleep doesn't stop the vibration,
	but restarting it does. This doesn't happen every call, maybe only
	about one in seven, but it still pretty annoying.<br/><br/>
	<h3>The Hardware</h3>
	The ZTE-Open hardware always felt cheat to me. The Flame is
	<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/flame-firefox-os-developer-phone/">billed
	as</a> "representative of the mid-tier phone hardware Mozilla and
	its partners are targeting over the coming year". I think that if
	the Flame is "mid-tier" I think that if there is ever a "high-end"
	device, it it going to blow the competition out of the water. The
	phone has enough weight to it that it doesn't feel cheap and
	skimpy. I have never seen it get bogged down and sluggish and it
	has weathered many tumbles off of my workbench without so much as
	a scratch.<br/>
	The back of the case is a smooth rubber-ish/matte material that
	seems to attract sawdust, pocket lint, and dust, but it may just
	be that I am often covered in those things myself.<br/>
	The screen is a 4.5in screen (FWVGA 854Ã—480 pixels) and is quite
	useable in direct sunlight. The screen also feels very responsive
	to touch events with is a wonderful improvement over the ZTE-Open
	where I often felt like I had to really press hard to get events
	to register.<br/><br/>
	<h3>The Development Ecosystem</h3>
	I haven't made any Firefox OS apps that are more than a few steps
	above trivial, but I really like the
	ecosystem. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager">
	App Manager</a> is very impressive. It uses adb to connect to the
	Flame and provides a nice place to modify the app's manifest,
	install the app on the phone, and debug the app on the phone. The
	App Manager is being replaced with the WebIDE from Firefox 34 on,
	but as I only use GNU Icecat and Debian Iceweasel, I haven't tried
	it out yet.<br/>
	Because Firefox OS apps are just HTML5 apps, developers are free
	to use whatever tooling they so choose. And because apps are just
	JS, CSS, and some HTML, any tool set is very easy to set
	up. Personally I use Emacs + Grunt as my web development tool
	set. Granted, I use Emacs + whatever as my tool set for any
	development. Mozilla has a bunch
	of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Reference_apps">reference
	apps</a> where you can see various techniques for using the web
	API present in Firefox OS, and there is a
	decent <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Quickstart">tutorial</a>
	if reading code doesn't do much for you.<br/>
	I have begun work on a non-trivial open web app that I intend on
	running (and using) on my Flame phone - an HTML5 Emacs clone. So
	far, it is going well and I will surely humblebrag/post about it
	once it has a minimal feature set. I am sure that I will also have
	a post specifically about developing for Firefox OS.<br/><br/>
	<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
	Do I like the Flame? Yes<br/>
	Knowing what I know now, would I get one again? Yes<br/>
	Would I reccomend that others get one? Eh, maybe. If you aren't
	getting a Flame to hack on, then it would behoove you to look at
	the Firefox Marketplace and see if there are apps there for
	everything that you want.<br/>
	I really like the Flame, and barring any catastrophes, I expect
	that it will be my daily drive phone for a long long time.
