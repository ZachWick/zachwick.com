	<h3>NB: THIS IS A RANT-Y PIECE OF WRITING. YOU ARE FOREWARNED.</h3>

	I started my evening today with a little light reading - the
	Telecommunications Act of
	1996 <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/tcom1996.txt">(ASCII
	Text Version)</a>. Previous to delving into the actual text, I
	perused
	the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996">Wikipedia
	article</a> and would like to briefly touch upon some thoughts.
	<br/>
	<h3>My Reason for Working</h3>
	I work solely for my own gain. I really don't care at all if what
	I do helps somebody else or not; I only care if the work is
	financially profitable for me or not. I do not expect any handouts
	or unsolicited help from anybody, and I do not give these things
	either. I do not ask for the fruits of another man's labor, I
	purchase the fruits of his labor with the fruit of my labor.
	<br/><br/>
	I grew up hearing the mantra "Work hard, play hard" constantly
	from my father. I also always heard my father say "You are going
	to work every moment of every day of your life, so you are either
	going to work for your family for free, or you will work for
	somebody else for pay." I have not yet found a possible third
	outcome to my days - I am either working for my family for free
	around the house, or I am working for somebody else for pay.
	<br/><br/>
	To that end, at some point in my future, I fully intend on owning
	a business that completely disrupts at least one industry. In that
	business, I intend to make as much profit as possible. I use the
	words "own", "make", and "profit" explicitly for the connotations
	that they possess; "Own" is for the fact that <u>my</u> business
	will be the fruit of <u>my</u> labor, and exist solely
	for <u>my</u> benefit. "Make" is used because my business will
	create its worth, instead of leeching off of the success of others
	as a parasite. I use "profit" because profit alone is what will
	drive my business. I, and by extension my business, will not allow
	anything to stand in our way; We will overcome, sidestep, or
	ignore any obstacle, any person, any law that gets in-between me
	and my profit. The fruit of my labor is mine and mine alone - To
	do with what I, and I alone, will.
	<br/>
	<h3>Monopolies</h3>
	Everything that I have read where the view that monopolies are bad
	is held, has used the argument that monopolies are bad because
	they hurt the consumer. This belief holds that a monopoly can
	charge a higher price than is fair for a good or service, and that
	a monopoly no longer has to be efficient as they can directly
	influence supply levels.
	<br/><br/>
	This is a crock of shit. If there is only one company that makes a
	particular good, or provides a particular service, consumers
	always have the option of "voting with their dollars." If a good
	or service is over priced, then the market is ripe for a competing
	business to undercut the incumbent and disrupt the industry. If a
	company no longer has any incentive to be efficient, again, the
	market is ripe for a competitor to spring up and drive
	competition.
	<br/><br/>
	All arguments for the viewpoint of monopolies being bad however
	are based on the assumption that the business exists only to
	provide a good or service as cheaply as possible to the consumer
	base. This is simply not true; a business should exist fore the
	sole purpose of squeezing every cent of profit possible out of the
	consumer base. It is for exactly that reason that I strive to
	somebody own a monopoly - that is where the profits are the
	greatest.
	<br/>
	<h3>Jiving with the FOSS Ideals</h3>
	I did struggle for some time making this belief jive with my
	wholehearted belief in free-as-in-freedom software. I have found a
	way to rationalize believing in completely free and unrestricted
	capitalism with free software in my own mind. Using very
	permissive licensing, such as the MIT or LGPL licensing, it
	possible to make these two ideals mesh. A permissive licensing
	scheme allows each consumer who legally obtains the good (or code,
	or application, or program) in some manner to do whatever they
	wish with the good that they have obtained. This extremely
	permissive scheme is the exact mechanism that drives
	competition. If I have a customer purchase a software library from
	me, and then start re-selling modified versions, by the virture of
	making as much profit as possible, I am incentivized to make my
	library better, cheaper, something in order to get consumers to
	"vote with their dollars" for my product over my competitor's. I
	don't believe that a restrictive copyleft license, such as the
	GPL, allows a free market to flourish. I hold the belief that for
	the reasoning outline above, such a licensing scheme stagnates the
	market. I would be very interested in hearing other opinions on
	this point however. You cannot learn unless your current beliefs
	are challenged.
	<br/>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	I sincerely hope that I someday earn the opportunity to practice
	what I preach (running my own business). I also hope that when I
	reflect on my life in my last seconds, that I can be look back
	without regret and know that I always acted in line with my
	ethics. I recognize the inherent selfishness in my beliefs and I
	contend that nobody and nothing other than myself (and those that
	I hold dear) should matter to me. These are my beliefs, and you
	are welcome and encouraged to disagree with them and hold your own
	beliefs. Just please do not attempt to force-feed your beliefs to
	me; I will however entertain civil discussion.
