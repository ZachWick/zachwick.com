Moving On to Other Projects
2013-10-23

A week ago today, I gave my notice at Barracuda Networks where I
have been employed for the last seventeen months; My last day
hacking on Copy.com[0] will be this Friday. I am leaving Copy for one
reason: The role that I had there was not one that would keep me
happy, feeling fulfilled, and be constantly forcing me to improve my
craft. Hacking on Copy has been a by-and-large positive experience.

In my tenure there I honed my skills and learned how
to operate in a corporate environment (something that I had never
experienced before). I really do think that Copy is a great
product and the people working on it are incredible - I see big
things in Copy's future and I am kind of sad that I will miss out
on experiencing them firsthand. When I started working on the Copy
web app, it was very very barebones. I helped flesh out its
initial feature set, and then worked on implementing new features
and participated in the team growing and growing. I think that I
was number seven-ish on the Copy team, and am leaving a team of twenty
nine not counting myself. The Copy account that I created on my
first day has a user id in the tens of thousands (lots of early
test accounts I guess) and now Copy has over two million active
users.
I will miss my Copy coworkers, and I wish them well. I plan on
focusing on getting the projects in my idea list implemented, so
look for those to appear on Github[1] and/or my personal site[2].

To the Copy folks that may end up seeing this, I have only this to
say:
    So long, and thanks for all the fish.
