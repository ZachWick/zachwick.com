  <p>
	As the title reads, I have switched to the Colemak keyboard layout
	on all of my devices. I switched mainly due to wanting to help
	alleviate some of the strain that I feel in my hands after a long
	day coding. I chose Colemak over Dvorak mainly due the similarity
	that Colemak and Qwerty have - I assumed that this would help the
	transition go more smoothly.<br/><br/>
	<h3>Progress</h3>
	I decided to switch cold-turkey as I thought that doing a part
	time switch would be less than ideal since I spend most of my day
	in front of a computer. Today is day two and I can already see
	improvment from yesterday. According to 'gtypist' my typing has
	gone from 180 WPM with 98% accuracy using Qwerty to 25 WPM with
	85% accuracy using Colemak. Clearly there is a ton of room for
	improvement!!<br/><br/>
	<h3>Other Notes</h3>
	I have also noticed that due to my slowed speed, I am being much
	more thoughtful of what I say. Maybe this trend of thinking before
	speaking will remain once my speed gets back to a reasonable rate.
