	Last weekend I had the privelege of volunteering, along with about
	60 other people, at <a href="http://annarborgivcamp.org">Ann Arbor
	Give Camp</a>. Essentially, a Give Camp is a weekend hackathon
	where non-profits with a technical need (website, analytics tool,
	donation tracking, etc.) that they do not have the budget for, get
	volunteer developers to fill that need with some awesomely cool
	project. The project that I worked on was updating the design of
	the website and implementing a membership directory for a
	contractors association.
	<br/><br/>
	Give Camp is different than any other hackathon that I have ever
	been too. First, you aren't building a project just because it has
	cool technical merit or because it might be a viable business. You
	are building some project because some do-good organization needs
	it to do more/better good works. Also, Give Camp is different in
	that you are building a technical project for a group that
	(probably) isn't very technically savvy. This fact tested both my
	patience when teaching our non-profit representative how to use
	the new system, and my design skills. I was challenged to come up
	with simpler wording on administration options, a more intuitive
	layout, and a streamlined workflow for the most common use case.
	<br/><br/>
	Give Camp also got me out of my personal tech bubble. I was
	unaware that there where people who self-identified as ".NET
	Developers" - Based on the make-up of my group, they are orders of
	magnitude more plentiful than I thought! That same revelation also
	made me see that a person could in fact do serious development on
	a windows machine. I guess that I knew that these things existed,
	I just never encounter them in my days as a web developer/embedded
	systems developer.
	<br/><br/>
	My weekend at Give Camp was an amazing experience. It felt good to
	do good, and I got out of my tech bubble. I would reccomend that
	anybody in the Ann Arbor area volunteer at next years Give Camp,
	and for those elsewhere, I would absolutely advocate that you look
	for a Give Camp near you.
