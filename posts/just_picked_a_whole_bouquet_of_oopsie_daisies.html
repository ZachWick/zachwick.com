	As you can see, zachwick.com is experiencing some technical difficulties right now. In the process of trying to clean up my Linode, I accidentally nuked it completely. Luckily, all of my code repos live on Github, and this seems a good as time as any to jump into static bloggin with Jekyll feet first!

	The ArduPhone project is still going strong too! I am in the process of rewriting my singleton functions as classes in a library. That being so, there is lots of changes happening in the APKeypad and ArduPhone repos - be aware if you are hacking on them.
