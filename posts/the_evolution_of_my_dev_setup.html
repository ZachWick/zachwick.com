  <p>
	As with everybody, my development setup has gone through many
	changes over the years and will inevitabley continue to change.
	<br/>
	<h3>The Beginning</h3>
	My first computer that was mine and mine alone was a IBM Thinkpad
	Type-2647 from my grandfather. It had Windows XP when I got it,
	but I remember that it just crawled along. This is when GNU/Linux
	entered my life. I was pointed to Damn Small Linux as a way to
	improve the performance, and instantly fell in love. Somewhere
	around middle school I found Ubuntu and used that distro until
	college (More on that later).<br/>
	This laptop still powers some stuff around my house this very day,
	and served as my daily driver all through middle school and high
	school. This is when I started programming on a computer instead
	of on my graphing calculator. I took some C++ classes at the local
	university and fell in love with the ordered, rational way of
	thinking through problems. I also started using Vim around this
	time. I was unaware that other text editors than vi and Vim
	existed.
	<br/>
	<h3>The Dark Ages</h3>
	In college, just like everybody else, I experimented. I got a
	MacBook Pro as a high school graduation gift, and spent all of
	college dual-booting Mac OS X and Ubuntu. In retrospect, I refer
	to these years as "The Dark Ages" because I guzzled the Apple
	kool-aid. I was the biggest Mac fanboy in my circle of friends. I
	wrote AppleScripts for fun (One randomized my MAC Address so that
	I didn't keep getting kicked off of the university's network for
	excessive use) and expounded the virtues of XQuartz on every
	street corner. During this time, my programming projects were
	still in C/C++, MatLab, Maple, and Mathematica. I lived in IDE's
	and hated being in a terminal.<br/>
	I was also still a Vim person during this time, although I used a
	GUI version of Vim.
	<br/>
	<h3>The Early Professional Years</h3>
	Right after college, I got a job doing iOS development. Still
	drunk on the Apple Kool-aid, I dove in head first. I now spent 16
	hours a day in Xcode and forgot about Vim. I got an iPhone and an
	iPad, and thought that my technical life was complete - all of my
	devices synced together, I had a continuous user experience across
	multiple devices - life was good.  At the tail end of this period,
	I started using GNU/Linux exclusively at home. I started with
	Ubuntu (as most do) and then moved to Fedora. It was at this point
	that I discovered the Free Software Foundation and their
	mission. I started to see cracks in what I thought was a perfect
	technological existence. I found Emacs, and never looked
	back. Then I found other GNU/Linux distros that were more "freedom
	oriented."
	<br/>
	<h3>The Modern Day</h3>
	I started using gNewSense because of its philosophy. I had many
	many pain points, but I kept using gNewSense because I wanted to
	use only FOSS software. At some point the pain points were too
	numerous, and I switched back to Fedora. I spent 18 months trying
	various distros for 1-2 months at a time until I found something
	that I liked. I tried Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, gNewSense (again),
	Parabola, and finally landed at Trisquel. Now here was a distro
	for me; an active community, a philosophy that I agreed with, and
	reliable/stable software that I could use for my day job (doing
	web development). I used Trisquel exclusively, both at home and at
	work, for ~8 months. Then again, I started to see the cracks in my
	world. The community was becoming more and more poisonous -
	countless email/forum threads of trolling and personal attacks. I
	had technological needs that couldn't be met by a 32bit system. I
	distro-hopped once more to Arch.
	<br/>
	<h3>Today's Arch Setup</h3>
	Today, I am using Arch Linux on my home and work machines. While I
	am uneasy with using the "straight" Linux kernel due to it
	containing non-free parts, I have yet to spend the time to switch
	to using a libre kernel. I still make sure that I am using and
	installing free-as-in-freedom software. I refer to my system as "a
	free system, built upon a _mostly_ free base." While this isn't a
	perfect solution, this setup works for me and allows me to get my
	work done with minimal interference. I live inside of Emacs all
	day at work; I use it for editing, irc, jabber, email, and as a
	terminal emulator. I couldn't be happier - however, I am sure that
	someday I will see some cracks once more, and hop away to some
	other distro and its promised wonderland.
