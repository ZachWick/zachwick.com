What is This 'Sublime Text 2' Hullaballo?
2012-06-27

With the release of Sublime Text 2.0 here in the last few days, I
thought that now would be an appropriate time to write out my reasons
for why I won't switch to Sublime Text.
I have a few co-workers who use Sublime Text. This means that my
exposure to ST is limited to watching people who do the same things
that I do use it; So comparing my workflow with theirs, I am
flabbergasted that they swear by ST.

Minimap
-------
When I watch these guys hack away in ST, the first cool feature that I
see is the minimap of the current file. This is a sweet feature - the
bird's eye view of a large file can be extremely helpful at
times. However, this feature doesn't sell me on ST. I have minimaps of
files in Emacs using minimap.el. After adding the Emacs Lisp file to
your load-path, it is three simple lines of Elisp to bind the
'minimap-create' and 'minimap-kill' to any key combo that you want.

Quick Step Next
---------------
This feature is really cool and has the potential to save you lots of
time. However, its inclusion in Sublime Text 2.0 is not the first
instance this ability existing. I can do the same thing, editing
multiple lines simultaneously, using the rectangle commands built into
Emacs (C-x r other_keys).

Conclusion
----------
Everybody has their editor of choice that has the feature set that
they are looking for. My choice of editor is Emacs, and I have yet to
see a reason to leave Emacs for any other editor.

Addendum
--------
Additionally, Emacs has a terminal editor, a text-based web browser,
and an email client that come with it. I don't have to mentally or
physically leave Emacs (or my beloved key bindings) all day - I am
sure that this increases my productivity by some non-trivial amount.
