	Some time ago I
	purchased <a href="http://zachwick.xxx">zachwick.xxx</a> because I
	thought that it could be funny someday. I get quite a bit of
	enjoyment from sending email replies from that domain to spammy
	recruiter emails and from giving out that same email in various
	professional settings. (See the end
	of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpvdOuTzOU0">my
	"Python + FUSE" talk</a> for a real life example)<br/><br/>
	Today I got the following email from the ICM Registry that made me
	laugh given that I host my personal blog on a .XXX TLD:<br/><br/>

	The whole point of me buying a .XXX TLD was to get laughs out of
	it, so mission accomplished I guess.
