	As much of the technical world is now aware, Mozilla has agreed to
	put <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/05/14/drm-and-the-challenge-of-serving-users/">HTML5
	EME support in Firefox</a> via implementing a DRM scheme. I am
	like many other Free Software folks who are very upset by the
	Mozilla Foundation acting in a way that I see as against their
	stated goals. Bradley Kuhn has a
	great <a href="http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2014/05/14/to-serve-users.html">post</a>
	in which he argues that the Mozilla Foundation (either by enabling
	the Mozilla Corporation, or by its own volition) by creating and
	distributing DRM is acting against its charitable purpose as posed
	to the IRS. After reading the documents that
	bkuhn <a href="http://www-archive.mozilla.org/foundation/documents/">linked</a>
	<a href="http://www-archive.mozilla.org/foundation/documents/mf-irs-501c3-application-attachment.pdf">to</a>,
	the Mozilla Foundation's stated goals and their actions do appear
	to be directly opposed.<br/><br/>
	The two statements made by the Mozilla Foundation in their
	IRS paperwork that I will draw on here are as follows:<br/><br/>
	<b>From "Part II, Question 1: Part B. Background"</b><br/>
	"Furture, some Web pages can be viewed solely on a certain type of
	computer or with a specific Web browsing software. The use of such
	non-standard technologies, often promoted by commercial software
	developers and vendors who are eager to maintain a competitive
	advantage, reduces the Web's universality and, consequently, limits
	Internet access on those unable or unwilling to afford the commercial
	technologies."<br/><br/>
	<b>From "Part II, Question 1: Part D. Key Activies"</b><br/>
	"The Foundation plans to engage in the following key activities in
	pursuance of its exempt purpose:"<br/>
	"(1) Facilitate the development of a web browser, e-main software and
	other Internet software that (a) are open source, (b) implement open
	standards, (c) are available free of charge to all Internet users
	around the world, regardless of the make or model of computers they
	use, the language they speak, or disabilities they may have, (d) are
	developed in an open process in which any interested party
	(individuals, government agencies, nonprofit organizations,
	corporations) can contribute, and (e) are powerful and easy to
	use."<br/>
	...<br/>
	"(5) Participate in Internet standards development efforts with the
	focus of promoting standards that complement the Foundation's exempt
	purpose (i.e., the availability of software to the general public
	free-of-charge, regardless of the make or model of computers that they
	use, the language they speak, or disabilities they may
	have)."<br/><br/>
	
	Based on the quote from "Part B" above, we can clearly tell that
	the Mozilla Foundation as it was when these forms were filed, knew
	that DRM was not something that would advance the free and open
	web. The fact that an organization behind a for-profit company was
	willing to publically say that is a very big deal.<br/>
	In the second quoted section above, the notable part is "(5)"
	wherein the Mozilla Foundation states that they will work
	promoting standards that complement the Mozilla Foundation's
	stated goals. One of these goals is "the availability of software
	to the general public free-of-charge, regardless of the make or
	model of computers that use, the language they speak, or
	disabilities they may have."<br/><br/>
	<h3>Deconstructing that Goal</h3>
	That sentence reads funny to me. Is the goal to make software
	available free-of-charge to users no matter what computers they
	use, language the speak, or their disablities? Meaning, for users
	of GNU/Linux, OS X, or Windows the cost is $0; For speakers of
	English, German, Spanish, etc. the cost is $0; etc. Or is the goal
	"to make software available" that has the following
	characteristics:<br/>
	<ul>
	  <li>is free-of-charge</li>
	  <li>will work regardless of computer specifics</li>
	  <li>will work regardless of language</li>
	  <li>will work regardless of a user's disability</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	If the correctly stated goal is the former, then the Mozilla
	Foundation has by enabling DRM in Firefox acted completly in
	accordance with their stated goals. If however, the later
	clarification is correct, then the Mozilla Foundation has misled
	many people for a long time, and is no longer even trying to act
	as it claimed it would.<br/><br/>
	I only use vanilla Firefox on my mobile phone, but now, I am
	unsure if I even will continue doing that. On all of my other
	machines, I use GNU IceCat and I would suggest that others do the
	same.<br/>
	I also suggest that others educate themselves on the HTML EME
	fiasco, and on the Mozilla Foundation's latest news before jumping
	to rash decisons.
